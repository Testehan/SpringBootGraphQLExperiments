After starting the application, in the browser nagivate to the below URL to get a UI console
    http://localhost:8080/graphiql

In that UI, you can add a query like the one from below, to get all the book names:
    {
      books
      {
        name
      }
    }

If you also want the pagecount field :
    {
      books
      {
        name
        pageCount
      }
    }

If you want to search for a book by id:
    {
      bookById(id:1)
      {
        name
        pageCount
      }
    }

If we want to get the author of a book as well:
    {
      bookById(id:1)
      {
        name
        pageCount
        author {
          name
        }
      }
    }
